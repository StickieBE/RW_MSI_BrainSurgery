		Ever get the feeling your prisoners are causing too much trouble?
		MS-Industries is here to provide a solution: Brain surgery!
		Keep your prisoners in check by directly manipulating their cranium
		using state of the art tools. Based on previous work by Arystique
		-Lobotomy-, we fixed the mod for .19 and added the possibility to
		immobilize prisoners for potential harvesting.
		Have fun with it!
