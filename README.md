# Brain surgery

## Description

Ever get the feeling your prisoners are causing too much trouble?

MS-Industries is here to provide a solution: Brain surgery!

Keep your prisoners in check by directly manipulating their cranium using state of the art tools.

We fixed the mod for (B19 / 1.0) and added the possibility to immobilize prisoners for potential harvesting.

To be able to perform brain surgeries, a doctor with medicine skill of 13 is required, as well as the required research.

The research can be unlocked using the advanced research table.

Available operations:
- Cerebellum removal (Immobilizes subject).
- Limbic lobe removal (Renders subject simple).

We are planning to release more updates in the near future, so stay tuned!

Have fun with it!
