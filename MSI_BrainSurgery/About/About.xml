	<description>Ever get the feeling your prisoners are causing too much trouble?

MS-Industries is here to provide a solution: Brain surgery!
Keep your prisoners in check by directly manipulating their
cranium using state of the art tools.
Based on previous work by Arystique -Lobotomy-,
we fixed the mod for (B19 / 1.0) and added the possibility
to immobilize prisoners for potential harvesting.

Have fun with it!</description>
