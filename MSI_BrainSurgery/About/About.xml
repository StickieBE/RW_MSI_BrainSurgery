	<description>Ever get the feeling your prisoners are causing too much trouble?

MS-Industries is here to provide a solution: Brain surgery!
Keep your prisoners in check by directly manipulating their cranium
using state of the art tools. Based on previous work by Arystique
-Lobotomy-, we fixed the mod for B19 and added the possibility to
immobilize prisoners for potential harvesting.

Have fun with it!</description>
