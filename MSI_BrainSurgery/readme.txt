# [B19]Brain surgery

## Description

Ever get the feeling your prisoners are causing too much trouble?

MS-Industries is here to provide a solution: Brain surgery!

Keep your prisoners in check by directly manipulating their cranium using state of the art tools.
We fixed the mod for B19 and added the possibility to immobilize prisoners for potential harvesting.

To be able to perform brain surgeries, a doctor with medicine skill of 13 is required, as well as the required research.
The research can be unlocked using the advanced research table.

Available operations:
- Cerebellum removal (Immobilizes subject).
- Limbic lobe removal (Renders subject simple).

We are planning to release more updates in the near future, so stay tuned!

Have fun with it!
